# React Weather App with CRUD Functionality and Routing

This is a React application that combines a weather app with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to check the weather for a specific city and manage a list of data entries. The application also utilizes routing to navigate between different pages.

## Features

- Weather App: Check the weather for a city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- CRUD Functionality: Add, edit, and delete data entries with first names and last names.
- Welcome Page: A personalized welcome page after logging in.
- Routing: Navigate seamlessly between different sections of the application.
